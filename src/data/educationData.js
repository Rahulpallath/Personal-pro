        decsription: "During my time at SRM University, I immersed myself in research, innovation, and skill-building, laying the foundation for my career in software engineering. I published two research papers, including 'Intelligent Securing of Industrial IIoT Data Using Consensus Mechanism' in a SCOPUS-indexed journal and 'Database Security Using Enhanced 3DES Model with 168 Key Bits' presented at the International Conference on Contemporary Engineering and Technology (ICCET). Alongside my academic pursuits, I earned multiple coding certifications in Java, JavaScript, and Python, sharpening my technical skills. For a minor project, I built an Accident Detection SOS Model using Raspberry Pi, showcasing my ability to apply technology to solve real-world problems. These experiences not only honed my technical expertise but also fueled my passion for innovation and problem-solving."
